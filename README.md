## Telecom Churn Predictive Model
This is the final project for TripleTen's Data Science and Programming Bootcamp. The project required the creation of a project plan, an analysis of customer data trends, and building and testing predictive models in order to forecast customer churn in a Telecom dataset.

### Introduction
The client nicknamed "Interconnect" is a telecom company looking for a solution to forecast and address client churn. Our data team has been tasked by the clientâ€™s marketing team to predict customer churn in order to offer promotional codes and special plan options to address / reduce customer churn.

### Objectives
Perform data analysis and create a final set of recommendations and action steps to reduce churn based on analytics and predictive modeling. Provide recommendations for model deployment and monitoring of customer churn. 

### Methodology
- Project Plan Development: Establish a baseline and high-level overview with a draft project plan detailing workflow, deliverables, and timeline, using a preview of RAW data.
- Data Collection and Exploratory Data Analysis: Clean, merge, and standardize data; develop descriptive statistics and visualize trends to inform feature engineering and predictive modeling.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features based on observable data trends, focusing on classifying users by longevity and customer loyalty.
- Model Selection and Training for Predictive Modeling: Select, test, and fine-tune an ML model to predict customer churn, using data splits for training, validation, and testing, and evaluate boosting methodologies for accuracy.
- Quality Assurance / Quality Review: Conduct an internal review to ensure the accuracy and precision of the analytics and predictive model.
- Conclusions and Recommendations: Compile final recommendations and action steps for reducing churn, including strategies for model deployment and monitoring.

### Conclusions
- Based on the analysis and predictive model, key indicators for customer churn are fiber optic service, contract type and length (tenure), and internet service in general.
- Model Accuracy: Continuously evaluate model accuracy with new data to identify at-risk customers early and offer incentives to prevent churn.
- ROI: Assess the return on investment (ROI) for churn prevention strategies by comparing the costs of marketing initiatives to the costs of customer churn and benchmark against industry averages.
